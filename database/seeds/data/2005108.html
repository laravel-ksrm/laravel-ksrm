        <b>List Of Experiments:</b> <br>
    1. Ramesh ‘s basic salary is input through the keyboard. His dearness allowance is 40% of basic salary and
    house rent allowance is 20% of basic salary. Write a C program to calculate his gross salary.<br>
    2. Write a program to take input of name, roll no and marks obtained by a student in 5 subjects each have
    its 100 full marks and display the name, roll no with percentage score secured.
    a) Write a C program to find out whether a given number is even number or odd number
    b) Write a C program to check whether a given year is leap year or not.<br>
    3. Design and develop an algorithm that takes three coefficients (a, b, and c) of a Quadratic equation
    (ax2+bx+c=0) as input and compute all possible roots. Implement a C program for the developed
    algorithm and execute the same to output the possible roots for a given set of coefficients with appropriate messages.<br>
    4. If the ages of Ramesh, Suresh and Mahesh are input through the keyboard, write a C program to determine the youngest of the three.<br>
    5. A character is entered through a keyboard. Write a C program to determine whether the character
    entered is a capital letter, a small case letter, a digit or a special symbol using if- else and switch case.
    The following table shows the range of ASCII values for various characters.
    Characters ASCII values
    A–Z 65 – 90
    a– z 97 – 122
    0 – 9 48 – 57
    Special Symbols 0 – 47, 58 – 64, 91 – 96, 123 – 127.<br>
    6. Write a C program which takes two integer operands and one operator from the user, performs the
    operation and then prints the result. (Consider the operators +, -, *, /, % and use switch statement).<br>
    7. Design and develop an algorithm to find whether a given number is Armstrong number or not. Implement
    a C program for the developed algorithm.<br>
    8. Design and develop an algorithm to check whether a given number is palindrome or not. Implement a C program for the same.<br>
    9. Write a C program to generate all the prime numbers between 1 and n, where n is a value supplied by the user.<br>
    10. Write a C program to generate the first N terms of Fibonacci sequence.<br>
    11. Write a C program to find the smallest and largest number in a given array.<br>
    12. Write a C program to find the frequency of a particular number in a list of integers.<br>
    13. Write a C program to sort the list of elementsusing
    a) BubbleSort b) Selection Sort.<br>
    14. Write a C program to search for an element in a list of elements using
    a) Linear search b) Binary search<br>
    15. Write a C program to read two matrices and perform the following operations
    a) Addition of two matrices
    b) Multiplication of two matrices<br>
    16. Partitioning an array
    Given a randomly ordered array of n elements, write a C program to partition the elements into two
    subsets such that elements ≤X are in one subset and elements ≥X are in another subset.<br>
    17. Write a C program to rearrange the elements in an array so that they appear in reverse order.<br>
    18. If a string and its reversed string are the same then the string is called a palindrome string. Design and
    develop an algorithm to check whether a given string is a palindrome or not and implement a C program for the same.<br>
    19. Write a C program to read two strings and perform the following operations without using built string library functions.
    i) String length ii) String reversing
    iii) Comparison of two strings iv) Concatenation of two strings<br>
    20. Write a C program to count the number of vowels, consonants, digits, blank spaces and special characters in a given string.<br>
    21. Write a C program to swap the contents of two variables using
    a) Call by value
    b) Call by reference.<br>
    22. Write a C program using recursion
    a) Find the factorial of a given number
    b) Print the Fibonacci series up to a given number.
    c) Find the GCD of two integers.<br>
    23. Write a C program to define a structure with the following members.
    Roll No., Name, marks in Sub1, Sub2, Sub3. Read the n students records and find the total marks of
    each student and print the result in the following format.
    Roll Number Name Sub 1 Sub 2 Sub 3 Total Marks Result
