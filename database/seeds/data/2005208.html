        2. Write a program to take input of name, roll no and marks obtained by a student in 5
        subjects each have its 100 full marks and display the name, roll no with percentage
        score secured.<br>
        3. a) Write a C program to find out whether a given number is even number or odd
        number.<br>
        b) Write a C program to check whether a given year is leap year or not.<br>
        4. Design and develop an algorithm that takes three coefficients (a, b, and c) of a
        Quadratic equation (ax2+bx+c=0) as input and compute all possible roots.
        Implement a C program for the developed algorithm and execute the same to output
        the possible roots for a given set of coefficients with appropriate messages.<br>
        5. If the ages of the Ramesh, Suresh and Mahesh are input through the keyboard, write
        a C program to determine youngest of the three.<br>
        6. A character is entered through keyboard. Write a C program to determine whether
        the character entered is a capital letter, a small case letter, a digit or a special symbol
        using if- else and switch case. The following table shows the range of ASCII values
        for various characters.
        Characters ASCII values
        A–Z 65 – 90
        a– z 97 – 122
        0 – 9 48 – 57
        Special symbols 0 – 47, 58 – 64, 91 – 96, 123 – 127.<br>
        7. Write a C program which takes two integer operands and one operator from the
        user, performs the operation and then prints the result. (Consider the operators +, -,
        *, /, % and use switch statement).<br>
        8. Design and develop an algorithm to find whether a given number is Armstrong
        number or not. Implement a C program for the developed algorithm.<br>
        9. Design and develop an algorithm to check whether a given number is palindrome or
        not. Implement a C program for the same.<br>
        10. Write a C program to generate all the prime numbers between 1 and n, where n is a
        value supplied by the user.<br>
        11. Write a C program to generate the first N terms of Fibonacci sequence.<br>
        12. Write a C program to find the smallest and largest number in a given array.<br>

        14. Write a C program to sort the list of elements using
        a) Bubble Sort b) Selection sort.<br>
        15. Write a C program to search for an element in a list of elements using
        a) Linear search b) Binary search<br>

        a) Addition of two matrices
        b) Multiplication of two matrices<br>
        17. Partitioning an array
        Given a randomly ordered array of n elements, write a C program to partition the
        elements into two subsets such that elements ≤X are in one subset and elements ≥X
        are in another subset.<br>
        18. Write a C program to rearrange the elements in an array so that they appear in
        reverse order.<br>
        19.If a string and its reversed string are same then the string is called as palindrome
        string. Design and develop an algorithm to check whether a given string is a
        palindrome or not and implement a C program for the same.<br>
        20. Write a C program to read two strings and perform the following operations
        without using built string library functions.
        i) String length ii) String reversing
        iii) Comparison of two strings iv) Concatenation of two strings<br>
        21. Write a C program to count the number of vowels, consonants, digits, blank
        space sand special characters in a given string.<br>
        22. Write a C program to swap the contents of two variables using
        a) Call by value
